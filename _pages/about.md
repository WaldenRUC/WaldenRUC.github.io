I'm a Ph.D candidate at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhicheng Dou](http://playbigdata.ruc.edu.cn/dou/) and [Prof. Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ) at GSAI.

My major research interests include:
- LLM-Generated Text Safety Analysis
- Pre-training for Personalized Chatbots (**Published in EMNLP'22**)
- Pre-training for Session Search (**Published in TKDE'25**)
- PEFT for RAG (**Published in AAAI'25**)
